## Welcome to the SDG Library Platform Documentation

This platform is a custom solution developed to assist in addressing two significant challenges related to Sustainable Development Goals Education (SDGED) and Global Citizenship Education (GCED):

1. **Accessibility of Resources:** The platform provides a centralized repository for SDGED and GCED resources, making it easier for teachers, researchers, students, policymakers, and NGOs in Qatar to access relevant materials efficiently. By aggregating resources and implementing a user-friendly interface, the platform streamlines the process of finding educational materials, thereby saving time and reducing stress associated with scattered resources.

2. **Stakeholder Collaboration:** The platform facilitates collaboration and connection among over 400 stakeholders in Qatar who share an interest in SDGs and sustainability. It allows users to connect with others working on similar initiatives, share insights, and collaborate on research projects. By breaking down silos and fostering a collaborative environment, the platform aims to enhance the collective impact of SDG initiatives in Qatar and reduce redundancy in research efforts.

### Target Audience

This documentation is intended for various stakeholders involved in the development, implementation, and maintenance of the Firebase/React website platform for SDGED and GCED resources in Qatar. These stakeholders include:

1. **Community Partner (CP):** The primary audience for this documentation is the community partner, which could be an organization, educational institution, or governmental entity responsible for promoting SDGs and sustainability initiatives in Qatar. The documentation provides a detailed overview of the project proposal, features, milestones, and maintenance plan, ensuring clarity on project objectives and requirements.

2. **Administrators:** Individuals responsible for managing and maintaining the platform, including adding new materials to the database, editing material information, and overseeing user accounts. The documentation guides administrators on how to use the platform's backend functionalities effectively.

3. **Developers:** The technical team responsible for building, maintaining, and updating the Firebase/React website. Developers rely on this documentation to understand the project requirements, implementation steps, and technical details related to Firebase, React, and other tools used in the development process.

4. **Teachers, Researchers, Students:** End-users who will utilize the platform to access SDGED and GCED resources, search for relevant materials, connect with other researchers, and collaborate on research initiatives. The documentation ensures these users understand how to navigate the platform, search for resources, and leverage its features effectively.

5. **Policy Makers, NGOs:** Stakeholders interested in accessing SDGED and GCED resources to inform policy decisions, educational initiatives, and sustainability projects. The documentation provides insights into how the platform can support their objectives and facilitate access to relevant materials.

### Core Functionalities

- **Data Extraction**: The platform employs advanced algorithms for data extraction from uploaded materials. When administrators add new resources to the database, the system automatically extracts metadata such as author information, publication date, and keywords. This process streamlines the addition of new materials and ensures that all relevant information is captured accurately.

- **Web Interface**: A user-friendly web interface, built with ReactJS, allows users to seamlessly navigate the platform and access SDGED and GCED resources. The interface is designed with a clean and intuitive layout, facilitating easy exploration of materials. Users can utilize various search filters, including keyword search, category filtering, and SDG-specific filtering, to quickly find the resources they need. Additionally, the interface provides detailed metadata for each resource, enabling users to assess its relevance before accessing the full content.

### Software Stack

- **Database**: 
- **API Server**: 
- **Web Interface**: ReactJS (Version 18.2.0)

### Project Deployment Requirements

- **Firebase Setup**: Before deploying the project, ensure that Firebase is properly configured and integrated with the React application. This includes setting up Firebase Authentication for user management, Firebase Realtime Database for data storage, and Firebase Hosting for deploying the web application.
